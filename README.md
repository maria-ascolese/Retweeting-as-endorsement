# Retweeting as endorsement

While the analysis of national election votes and voter turnout is essential in understanding the composition of electorate by party in a given country, social media are ever more relevant in expressing endorsement and dissent, approval and dissatisfaction; hence, social media represent an incredibly rich treasure of public opinion data.
In this brief paper, Twitter users’ engagement with official accounts of the five major Italian parties is placed in the fragmented context of Italy, which notoriously bears consistent socioeconomical differences across territories. The aim is to investigate whether Twitter users’ endorsement of political content does constitute a reflection of electoral behaviour. Information regarding electoral behaviour across territories is drawn from the last national election, occurred on 25th September 2022.
