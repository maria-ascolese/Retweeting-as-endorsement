# Retweeting as endorsement

While the analysis of national election votes and voter turnout is essential in understanding the composition of electorate by party in a given country, social media are ever more relevant in expressing endorsement and dissent, approval and dissatisfaction; hence, social media represent an incredibly rich treasure of public opinion data.
In this brief paper, Twitter users’ engagement with official accounts of the five major Italian parties is placed in the fragmented context of Italy, which notoriously bears consistent socioeconomical differences across territories. The aim is to investigate whether Twitter users’ endorsement of political content does constitute a reflection of electoral behaviour. Information regarding electoral behaviour across territories is drawn from the last national election, occurred on 25th September 2022.
